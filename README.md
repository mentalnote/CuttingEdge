# CuttingEdge
A simple OpenGL game engine with a focus on maintaining low-level access to all stages of rendering.
NOTE: As the project is using SDL2-2.0.3 for Visual C++ it requires VS2015 to compile. Earlier versions of visual studio have differently defined symbols required by this version of SDL.
